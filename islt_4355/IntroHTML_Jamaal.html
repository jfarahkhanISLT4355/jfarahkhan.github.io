<p>In this code, you will find a few different HTML tags and elements that we will discuss more in Week 2.</p>
    <p style="color:chocolate;">You can do <span style="font-weight: 600; text-decoration: underline;"> a great many things</span> with <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: deeppink;">only HTML and CSS alone</span>, such as changing the <em>color</em> of this font. And even changing the <span style="font-family: cursive; color:blueviolet;"> type of font presented!</span></p>
    <p>We can change any number of things, much like a Word Processor:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Font Type</li>
        <li>Font Weight</li>
        <li>Font Size</li>
        <li>Font Color</li>
        <li>Font Emphasis (underline, italics, etc.)</li>
        <li>Text Alignment</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Now you try! </p>
    <p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20pt;"> Figuring things out.</p>
